monome application library for Python.

Written by Artem Popov <artfwo@gmail.com>

pymonome is currently being rewritten. README will be updated when asyncio/aiosc port is done.

---

This package depends on aiosc, which is installable using pip.

See the examples directory for usage examples.

Make sure serialosc is running when you run the examples.  Have a
monome handy to test functionality.
